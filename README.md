# social-network-analysis

Project Structure:
User Class: Represents a user in the social network.
Graph Class: Represents the social network graph with methods to add users and connections.
SocialNetworkAnalysis Class: Implements the Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path.
CentralityMeasures Class: Finds the most connected user.
SocialNetworkCLI Class: Provides a command-line interface for interaction.

Features Covered:
User Class: Represents a user with ID and name.
Graph Class: Manages user connections using an adjacency list.
Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between two users.
Centrality Measures: Identifies the most connected user.
Command-Line Interface: Allows interaction with the graph to find shortest paths and most connected users.

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding graph-based social network analysis using Java and DSA principles
